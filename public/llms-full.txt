## What is OpenHaven

OpenHaven is a community-led convergence hub for the P2P and decentralized protocol landscape,
built in partnership with the Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA). The Open Protocol Navigator
helps people find the right protocols for their use case using a Use Cases → Affordances → Tools
navigation model.

Mission: Making the open protocol landscape interoperable and interact-able — navigable by the
people who need it. Technical convergence depends on social convergence.

Data quality: All entries are human-verified. Claims are marked as verified or claimed (unverified).
Every entry carries a last_investigated date. This is a beta — data is real but growing.
